<h1>osTicket - Post Installation Setup</h1>
This tutorial will demonstrate the post configuration setup of the osTicket system.<br />

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
we’ve successfully completed the base installation and configuration of osTicket. Now we’ll move on to some post-installation system administration, starting with creating custom user roles within the help desk.

To begin, navigate to:
Admin Panel → Agents → Roles

From here:

Click “Add New Role”

Enter a name for the role (e.g., SysAdmins)

Assign the appropriate permissions

In this example, the Supreme Admin role is granted full system permissions to simulate an all-access administrative user.

🔐 Note: Roles in osTicket define what each agent is allowed to see and do. Not all agents should have full access, so use roles to apply principle of least privilege where appropriate.

If configured correctly, you should see your newly created “Supreme Admin” role listed on the Roles page.

Next, we’ll set up a new department within osTicket to help organize agents based on their responsibilities.

Navigate to:
Admin Panel → Agents → Departments

From here:

Click “Add New Department”

Enter the department name (e.g., System Administrators)

Optionally configure additional settings such as:

SLA plans

Department manager

Auto-response and email settings

💡 Note: Each agent in osTicket is assigned to a department based on their role. In this example, we’re creating a System Administrators department where our Supreme Admins will be designated. This helps structure workflows and ensures proper routing of tickets and responsibilities.

Once saved, the new department should appear in your Departments list.

After creating departments, the next step is to configure teams. Teams in osTicket allow you to group agents across different departments based on skill sets or support tiers. This provides flexibility in assigning tickets to specialized groups, regardless of departmental structure.

Navigate to:
Admin Panel → Agents → Teams

Key points:

A default Level I Support team is already provided.

For this example, we’ll create a Level II Support team composed of advanced technicians from multiple departments.

To create a team:

Click “Add New Team”

Enter a name (e.g., Level II Support)

Add agents who specialize in specific products or advanced issues
